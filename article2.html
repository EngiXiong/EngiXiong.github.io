            <h2>Stock Predictions</h2>
            <p>America wants to undermine entire Chinese industries: the US has for years increasingly restricted
                China’s semiconductor exports. Companies like ASML, a Dutch semiconductor manufacturing company, get
                caught and suffer in the crossfire. For instance, in 2020 they pressured the Dutch government, due to
                national security concerns regarding China’s militarism, to ban the export of EUVs, something of which
                they are known for, However, in the process of cutting off a major customer, ASML will and has
                experienced considerable losses. According to ASML’s 2023 second-quarter financial report, it was
                revealed that China alone accounted for over 20% of their total earnings. What’s worse is that the US is
                demanding further restrictions on ASML to discontinue the sales of DUV equipment (less advanced
                lithography equipment) to China starting in 2024. If this were to happen, which it is very likely to be,
                given that ASML still has not yet renewed their licenses to trade with China for next year, ASML is
                estimated to suffer from over $2 billion dollars in lost revenue. A DUV sanction will be much more
                damaging for ASML than the ban on EUV states Wang Xialong, a research head at ICWise, a Shanghai
                semiconductor consultancy. Overall, ASML’s transports and profits are heavily constrained, and will
                continue to suffer more. For a company in this much relentlessly sanctioned-heated hot water, they’re
                limited from achieving their full potential and it makes them very unstable.</p>
            <p>Although semiconductors are pivotal components for much of our widely-used technologies, making them
                reliable products—the companies that make them can change. Especially if their customer, who has the 2nd
                largest economy in the world and poised to become the 1st, becomes their competitor…</p>

            <h2>Dream Music</h2>
            <p>The song with Technoblade in it was actually pretty good (I want to hear absolutely NO pitchforking or
                tar and feathering). The “those things I’ve never said” part that sounded kinda muffled was “peak” (as
                they say). The song kinda reminded me that he, and all people, are just regular people—and regular
                people all have something unique about them.

            <p>P.S. Okay, after listening to it once more, it’s okay…</p>

            <p>What if you reaped not what you sow; instead, what if you reaped what you didn’t sow. I’m distinctly
                referring to a particular thing regarding academics. Do you perhaps know what it is? Or perhaps you may
                know other things related </p>

            <p>Perhaps it’s a good way to look at life though: seeing certain flaws in the system that you can take
                advantage of to really get an edge over.</p>
