            <p>

            <p style="color: rgb(234, 254, 254);font-size: 1.3em;">October 30th, 2023</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">This month’s progress</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>What took hours to load before now takes less than a second. Ok, it may have actually only taken like 6
                seconds, but you know it’s like practically the same thing–the pain of knowing my users have to wait 5
                more seconds–5 more unnecessary seconds that may cause them to click off! Just 5 seconds is all it takes
                between keeping user retention or not. Just look at what people have to do to keep 5 seconds of your
                attention on TikTok (I know you have seen some things…). As of 10/30/23, ENGIXIONG corp has completely
                resolved this problem–just look at the difference yourself (ex. The animations you saw when you opened
                this page, the About page). Furthermore, our newly released page/feature, EngiXiong Paths, pushes
                creativity and innovation–where only limitless passion and heart is your limit (no limit). Of course all
                talk is just all talk, and actions speak louder than words. Just tell me, is there a single static thing
                in EngiXiong Paths? </p>

            <p>When you work with ENGIXIONG, you work with faster, you work you with smarter, you work with better. We
                are a TZ-inspired company; We are a company with a TZ-level foundation; We as a company are +4 standard
                deviations in progress, development, innovation; Joe Biden once said, “look at the alternative'' as an
                excuse for his shortcomings. In contrast to the president, ENGIXIONG states “just look at them, look at
                the alternatives–you’ll come running to me.” Essentially, you’re either investing in EngiXiong, someone
                who’s O(log(n)) in regards to progress/skill, someone with actual passion and heart to do more when
                others have quit, to continue pushing when he’s at his limit, someone when you look at him, you look
                above up at him, or…I’ll let you discover the alternative.</p>

            <h2>Gain</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Great decision to dollar cost average the KO stock–instead of buying a bunch when it was at $58, I bought
                one, then a month later it became around $52 at its lowest (so amazing I saved $6). There literally
                could not have been a better time to dollar cost average (in regards to the past few years).
                Unfortunately, this opportunity is no longer available.</p>

            <p>I would have never even gotten into stocks at all had I not read Atomic Habits. It was learning that to
                pick stocks successfully, you’d need to understand the story of it–to me it was kinda like a scavenger
                hunt or like a puzzle in finding details/events of the company to see if it matches requirements for a
                successful company. It was interesting to imagine how companies will sustain themselves long-term, for
                instance: would people have a higher quality of life which would lead to them to consume more flavorful
                drinks–especially when food science has gotten to the point of replicating sugary taste without the
                sugar, carbs, carlores, etc. I thought so and bought 2 KOs (I have not ever tried Coca Cola…). It was
                also interesting to see the effect on branding–how just one red-label on a bottle makes something so
                ignorable, forgettable into the centerpiece–how it makes a multi hundred-billion dollar company–how it’s
                what makes the people choose it over a possible drink that replicates their exact taste once food
                science becomes so advanced.</p>

            <h2>Blue Lock Ego</h2>
            <p>TZ said that ego can cause the stagnation of progress.
                TZ also mentioned the story of Blue Lock where the top soccer players compete with each other for a spot
                on the top global soccer team, and those who fail won’t ever get a second chance. How does one
                distinguish oneself and climb above everyone when everyone else is top 1%? In the show, their eyes
                display their “ego,” in different ways and extremes, such as dilating, shrinking, or even changing
                color. One person's “ego” is the fear of losing that he becomes so desperate to win at all costs–to push
                himself at all costs. One person’s eyes express their worth and determination–how many punches they can
                take and still push through with relentless resolve. </p>

            <p>I guess if you’re competing with a guy with pupils 1 cm larger…it’s over(?).</p>

            <p>Also, the only understanding I have of Blue Lock is from like 3 minutes of reading TZ’s brief
                description.</p>
