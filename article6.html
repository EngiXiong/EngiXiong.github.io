                <p style="color: rgb(234, 254, 254);font-size: 1.3em;">October 25th, 2023</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">How it Ends</h2>
                <p>It began with a pre-calc H test. The topic? Everything. I then had a finance test (could not get a break). However, after being in a volcano, it was nice for it to become just a pool of scorching water. As I’m writing this, I have a 35 problem UTexas due 💀💀. Yet, what followed after this relentless day, something I almost missed–something I almost lost, was a greeting by DMO: “Hi former student–hi Kevin.” Had I walked out of class quicker or slower, I would have lost this moment–I would have lost knowing he remembered.</p>
                
                <p>AL possibly saved me: he told me that the final UTexas was 35 questions. I was completely planning to do it Thursday night–essentially I would have been diving into the Mariana Trench with a 5 gal oxygen tank instead of 500 gal without knowing.</p>
                
                <p>”Chat got it right. I mess with it”–WB. This I felt was so true: I absolutely needed help with the 4 UTexas’ this week. </p>
                
                <h2>10x</h2>
                <hr style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <p>This section is primarily dedicated to MG. There are two things–two reasons that determine if you will be in the +3 or +4 standard deviations for potential/future skill. Estinally, what separates–distinguishes–you from the 99% or even 99.9% if you're in +4 in future, potential skill. Passion, actual heart is what pushes you to do more than everyone else: it’s why you want to do a little bit extra when everyone else has stopped or failed; it’s why you persist and continue even when you’ve reached your limit, breaking point. “I like to do a little bit extra. They don’t pay me for that”–DOM. Your current skill level doesn’t determine your future skill–having genuine passion, heart does: it already determines if you’re in +3 or +4 standard deviation in the bell curve for potential, future skill. Of course, if you’re in BC, you already have the initial competency, skill level, discipline, and IQ to be a 10x developer, in which you work the efficiency and value of 10 people–you’ll surpass most in the long term. These two factors–two gifts lead you to exponential growth: I'm talking about absolutely dominating the competition, where you efficiently finish the classwork in 1-2 minutes and watch as others labor for 10-20 minutes. Passion and heart is what’ll drive you: it’s what brings unrelenting perseverance, persistence, advancement for progress to reach success–”+3 or +4” success. It’s why you’ll continue while you see others fade out behind you. MG, you can get into FAANG–I say this the same way DOM said “Hi Kevin” to me to show he remembered me. MG, you have the IQ. MG, you have the competency. MG, I see your pathos (anaphora attempt).</p>
                
                
                <p>The best time to start was 10 years ago–the second best time now. I started 3 years ago, so in 7 years I’ll have done it at the best time. In 7 years my +4 standard deviations spot for the bell curve in future, potential CS skill will become current CS skill (going from +3 standard deviations [corresponding to the entire SHS population] to +4 standard deviations [corresponding to the global population]). In 10 years, you will have done it at the best time by starting now.</p>
