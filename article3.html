            <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">To be Mca or to be Edge</h2>
            <p>We will explore an objective viewpoint on which gym is objectively the best.</p>

            <p>Starting off for the pricing, graphically, the Edge can be seen as having a higher y-intercept but with a
                slower slope while Mca has a lower y-intercept but a more steeper slope. People paying for Mca’s higher
                price may not even be doing so for the variety of things they have and are just solely trying to get big
                and may not be getting the most value for their money; “I’m not trying to throw an orange ball into a
                basket”-A. When it comes to pricing, The Edge has a more strategic and tailored cost plan that it’s made
                to motivate you to keep pushing forward towards your goal, as with a higher initial deposit you're
                making a more solid commitment that will push you to continue which rewards you with more fruits for
                your labors (reaping a drastically smaller price) in the long run.
                Although The Edge has psychological tactics embedded in their program designed to incentivize you to
                your full potential, sometimes it’s the community that makes the difference between going or not going.
                Although the Edge may have more convenient transport, sometimes it may as well not even be there if you
                don’t feel like going there.</p>

            <p>When it comes to family, at the Y I could smell the passion and biological familyness; stories such as “I
                lift so I can see my veins”-L just cannot be found at Edge.</p>

            <p>At The Edge I did see some causal, planetary-scale 2000+ pound benches by A. I was unable to do the
                vacuum workouts…(I do not know how doing it is even humanly possible!)</p>

            <p>When it comes to scariness I did feel that The Edge had a lot more people which made it more scary
                overall (they are very scary). However, A and N really single-handedly (or say double-handedly) canceled
                out the scariness.</p>

            <h3>The verdict</h3>
            <p>The Edge has a purposeful, rewarding pricing plan, but it just does not match up with Mca, especially if
                there is a mandatory pu to there. I could have very easily sugar coated everything–to be politically
                correct–but I choose to state the truth for everyone’s benefit. Essentially, I just think that the Y has
                a softer/at ease vibe (not during workout) to it (maybe it’s because the Edge has a lot of people).</p>

            <h3>The Schedule</h3>
            <p>My outline for pu days might be the same rate I post articles. So in theory, if I upload daily, it might
                mean daily pull ups. However, it may likely be a weekly pu at the Y.</p>

            <h2>K-Pop</h2>
            <p>The first time I heard a K-Pop song (BLACKPINK’S Pink Venom) I did not get the appeal–essentially, I
                thought
                it was a bit mid…(as they say). I would find some more mainstream/broad appeal songs later: below are
                some
                of them (or at least ones I thought sounded nice) if you would like to see.</p>
