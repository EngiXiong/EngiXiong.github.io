                <p><span>Be around three: you’ll slowly become the fourth.</span> Your seating arrangement in say, your science class, can very well determine the direction of your life: the people that are most approachable to you can very well be the ones that influence you the most. But deciding to be with people that are at the same ivory pillar, or perhaps a few ivory pillars higher (MG) than yours–you are setting a safety net to never “fall off,” as you have a series of grappling hooks on towers higher than yours, and perhaps those grappling hooks can even help you rise up to those towers. Your friends–your circle–is your foundation; it sets your boundaries: you may have several anchors dragging you down to fall off, or you may have several elevators helping you to rise to heights you thought to be impossible to reach. Friends can help you passively improve, something that doesn’t need any effort. Essentially, do you have a grandmaster team setup, or perhaps do you need to switch out a Genji for a Bastion (for better synergy and sustainability) to reach diamond 3. Or maybe go with the meta: 2 tanks, 2 dps, 2 support (at least one direct healer) for a successful framework.</p>
                
                <h3>Oh man…this has derailed so much</h3>
                <p>In TF2 competitive invite (highest level) 6s, getting one pick can be the catalyst for breaking the stalemate and the difference between capturing mid or even winning the game: getting the med pick when they have uber ad immediately reverses the advantage the opposing team had, as they’re forced to backpedal. However, if you didn’t have right team composition, you may have not won at all, let alone getting the med pick; if you decided to not have a flank scout, you might have not had anyone to catch the med off guard or to punish for bad positioning; you suddenly lose a lot of your capability, and in a way, your only as good as your team. Basically, not having the right team composition can decide the outcome of something before it even starts. It’s the choice of whether to have a pyro or flank scout that determines whether the effort you put in translates into a loss or a win. What may be the IRL meta team composition? Idk but I think a general guideline might be 2 BCs, actually maybe 6 BCs</p>
                
                <h3>Ok, back on topic (back on the train tracks)</h3>
                <p>I’ve been following, Frying pan, (not really, just watched one video of him talking how he got an internship at META and $400k at like 20 💀). I reflected on what distinguishes–or separates him from me. I think I have the answer…wait actually 2: “The best time was 10 years ago, the 2nd best time is now.” It’s hard to see what’s at the top of mt-everest, let alone ever seeing yourself reach it–but what if you started climbing 3650 days ago? There may be another factor to consider: “Everyone can make it to GM [Overwatch grandmaster], obviously not at the same time, because it's a bell curve and that's mathamatics.” Essentially, there may be higher y-intercepts and higher slopes, but what counts is the domain restriction, in which it should be (x,∞); someone with a more limitless domain restriction can outcompete someone with both a higher y-intercept and slope in regards to progress and skill. The starting part of the domain restriction can be just as important as its ending part.</p>
                
                <h3>Immediate</h3>
                <p>Have a 10,000 (almost the magnitude of how much A benches) word essay assigned? Write 3 sentences–or the equivalent of 2 minutes worth of work and stop–you’ll find that you don’t want to stop, but you’ll find that you started. What if you started 10 years ago? You’d only need like a week to finish.</p>
                
                <h3>Man up</h3>
                <p>Do 2 minutes; it can really be 2 minutes if you want</p>
                
                <h2>A Tough Lesson</h2>
                <p>In the span of one day, I’ve been given the chance to see a mirror of myself. Earlier this day I criticized others because they were just starting out in something–I displayed a very narrow mindset and was just inconsiderate. And, almost like karma, someone said that I was bad at math for being in pre calc h as a junior. It made me realize that criticizing doesn’t help anyone; it doesn’t give you respect and is just used to possibly fill an ego–an ego can be deadly as it can be the source of stagnation (TZ said that). Although I may not completely guarantee this promise: I will try to be less quick to judge and be more open minded in my decisions–to not unnecessarily criticize, but compliment.</p>
