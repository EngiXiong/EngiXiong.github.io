                limited time span, however, it has its pros: it perhaps pressures higher efficiency, higher energy,
                higher production/publish rate.

            <h2>Rare biography</h2>
            
            <p>Beginning Mandarin in middle school, Hockey C has always been grinding to obliterate the end goal for
                being in AP Mandarin: consistently bulking for the mandated 200 pound requirement, learning high level
                mandarin (“ni de xing ge shi shen me”) to impress and shock the competition. But all talk is just talk,
                and it’s known that “actions speak louder than words”: during a day where no one else decided to go to
                the Y, C still committed and dedicated the same energy for the workout, not stopping short of anything
                in order to keep up his exercise momentum and discipline acquired through years of development (though
                was caught lacking once by the entire Mandarin class from a missed workout).</p>

            <p>Besides bombarding the competition in Mandarin, C oppresses the entire opposition in hockey from his
                years of experience, and is well on his way to becoming a captain of the Staples hockey team</p>

            <h3>Sandwiches</h3>
            <p>During lunch today, C had a pb&j. Several Mandarin students had the exact pb&js as well. I believe that
                the pb&j really symbolized the true mandarin learners and real ones, in which C is one of them.</p>

            <h3>APUSH</h3>
                    <p>APUSH is a hard course according to many, yet, I think C, based on what I’ve heard, really
                        distinguishes himself and takes it very seriously–dedicating genuine effort and passion into it.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Beats Headphones</h2>
                    <p>Please, if you would like to pay $99.99 for refurbished, black-gold color, studio3 beats headphones
                    ($349.99 on Beats website). Okay, if I’m being real you probably could get them around $160 in any
                    retail store (but you don’t know that! But know you do…).</p>

                    <h2>Song</h2>
                    <p>I don’t know if this is an acquired taste, niche song, or if it may be a hidden gem. Feel free to
                        have a listen to it if you’re bored or have time: “I DO” by (G)I-DLE.</p>
